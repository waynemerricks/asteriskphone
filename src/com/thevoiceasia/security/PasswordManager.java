/**
 * Simple class to 'secure' salt+hash a password using BCrypt
 * Provided by Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org>
 * 
 * Having found this implementation it seems kind of silly to wrap it
 * in a class but it keeps me sane using my own terminologies.
 * 
 * Uses 13 Rounds of BCrypt which takes approx 1000ms to hash a password
 * Use this class from its main method and it will benchmark 10 passwords
 * 
 * According to BCrypt docs, you want as many rounds as you can afford to
 * wait for, however they also say 8ms is a bare minimum but that sounds 
 * a lot per second to me.
 * 
 * Valid range for rounds is 4 to 31 - be aware that 31 seems to complete
 * ridiculously quickly so its a probably bug that high up (30 is working
 * fine and takes a calculated 36.4 Hours to hash).
 * 
 * These numbers are all single threaded, so 1 second per hash is still
 * the same on a quad core but you can have 4 threads so 4 hashes per second
 * (not the same as 1 hash per .25 seconds).
